# Fast-Power
computes large powers in finite fields with the "Square-and-Multiply Algorithm"

INSTALL
================================================================================

Just do make and everything gets done.

To find h where

    g ^ a = h (mod n)

just do ./fastPow -b g -e a -m n

alternatively just do ./fastPow and follow the prompts onscreen to set the base exponent and modulus.
